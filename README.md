# HR Employee Attrition Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing HR employee attrition data to gain insights into factors contributing to employee turnover. Using **Power BI**, we have created interactive dashboards and visualizations to help HR teams make data-driven decisions for improving employee retention.

The analysis explores patterns in employee attrition by **department, job role, gender, age, salary, performance rating, and tenure**.
